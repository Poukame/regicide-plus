# Regicide Companion Plus

An app to assist you during your Regicide boardgame plays. This is not the official app but it includes more options and quality of life improvements.

## Why this app?

Hi, I'm Guillaume aka Poukame. I created this app because I love playing Regicide with my friends or online.
In the online version on BGA, there are some interesting options to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.

I found them interesting and was disappointed by the official app not proposing them. So I decided to create one that would include options for more challenging plays and some quality of life improvements.

## Features

Everything from the official companion app plus:

- Choose from advance options: enemies health, enemy attack, max combo card, max animal companion card...
- Progress percentage that allows you to compare you score in the most challenging battles,
- Actions reminders (heal, draw cards, perfect kill...) so you don't forget or need to calculate things,
- Use the app in landscape or portrait mode,
- Install the app on your computer or phone and acts like a native app with OFFLINE mode
